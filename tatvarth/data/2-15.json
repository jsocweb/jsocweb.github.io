  "explanation": "The word ‘sense’ has already been explained. The word five is intended to determine that there are only five senses and no more. Should not the organs of activity such as the organ of speech be mentioned here? No. This is the section dealing with cognition (upayoga). Those that are the instruments of cognition (upayoga) alone are mentioned here; not those that are the instruments of activity (kriyā). There is no limit to the instruments of activity (kriyā). All the limbs and minor limbs (ańgopāńga) that are formed due to the fruition of name-karma are the instruments of activity. These are not included.<br /><br />The subdivisions of the senses are mentioned next.",
