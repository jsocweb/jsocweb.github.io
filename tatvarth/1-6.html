                    The true nature of substances (soul, etc.) described in detail through
                    the rule of installation (nāma), etc., can be ascertained through
                    pramāõa and multitude of naya. The characteristics and divisions of
                    pramāõa and naya are described now. Pramāõa is of two kinds,
                    namely, for oneself (svārtha) and for others (parātha). All forms of
                    knowledge, except scriptural knowledge, constitute pramāõa for
                    oneself. But scriptural knowledge is of both kinds – for oneself and for
                    others. Valid knowledge or knowledge itself constitutes pramāõa for
                    oneself and knowledge in form of words constitutes pramāõa for
                    others. The naya(s) are divisions of pramāõa.
                    <br /><br />
                    It is contended that naya should be mentioned first as it consists of
                    fewer letters than pramāõa. It is not a fault. Pramāõa is mentioned
                    first as it is of superior excellence. As a rule, excellence is invincibility.
                    How is pramāõa of superior excellence? As pramāõa is responsible for
                    the origin of naya, it is of superior excellence. It has been said in the
                    Scripture that after knowing the substance with the help of pramāõa,
                    ascertaining its one particular state or mode is naya. Secondly, the
                    scope of pramāõa comprises all attributes of the substance. It has been
                    said in the Scripture that pramāõa is sakalādeśa – comprehensive and
                    absolute, and naya is vikalādeśa – partial and relative. For this reason,
                    too, pramāõa is of superior excellence.
                    <br /><br />
                    Naya is of two kinds, dravyārthika naya and paryāyārthika naya.
                    Paryāyārthika naya is concerned with bhāva nikÈepa – the present
                    mode (paryāya) or actual state (bhāva) of the substance. Since bhāva
                    nikÈepa refers to the mode (paryāya) of the substance, it is specific and
                    falls under paryāyārthika naya. Dravyārthika naya is concerned with
                    the other three nikÈepa – nāma, sthāpanā, and dravya – which are
                    general in nature. Dravyārthika naya refers to the general attributes
                    of the substance, and paryāyārthika naya to the constantly changing
                    states or modes (paryāya) of the substance. That which has the
                    substance as its object is the standpoint of substance – dravyārthika
                    naya. That which has the mode (paryāya) as its object is the standpoint
                    of modes – paryāyārthika naya. Both the substance and the modes are
                    ascertained by pramāõa (comprehensive knowledge).
                    <br /><br />
                    One method of understanding the nature of the soul, etc., by pramāõa
                    and naya has been explained. Another method of ascertaining the
                    soul, etc., is mentioned next.
