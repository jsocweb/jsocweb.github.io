  "sutra": "अविग्रहा जीवस्य॥२७॥<br />Avigrahā jīvasya ॥27॥",
  "audiosrc": "2-27.mp3",
  "arth": " [ जीवस्य ] मुक्त जीव की गति [ अविग्रहा ] विग्रहरहित - वक्रतारहित, सीधी - होती है ।",
  "meaning": "The movement of the liberated (mukta) soul is without a bend – avigraha.",
  "vyakhya": "मुक्त-जीव की गति मोड़े रहित होती है। अर्थात्‌ मुक्त-जीव श्रेणी के अनुसार ऊपर गमन करके एक समय में ही सिद्धक्षेत्र में जाकर ठहर जाता है | ",
  "explanation": "‘Vigraha’ here means hindered, not straight – vyāghāta. The motion (gati) without a bend is ‘avigraha’. To whom does it occur? It occurs to the soul. To what kind of the soul? To the liberated soul. How is the liberated soul implied here? It is inferred from the mention of the transmigrating souls in the next sūtra. It is mentioned in the previous sūtra that the transit in space takes place in straight lines (śreõī). Does it not follow that there is no deviation from rows of space? So this sūtra is meaningless. No. This is to indicate that in the instances of the previous sūtra there may be sometimes irregular movement also. But the rule regarding time and space has been mentioned therein. True; but it is established only from this sūtra.<br /><br />The liberated soul is free from ties. Hence it goes up without impediment to the end of the universe. Is there obstruction in case of the embodied soul, or is it as in case of the liberated soul? ",
