  "explanation": "The infernal regions are described later. Those who are born in the infernal regions are infernal-beings (nārakī). The beings who are born by spontaneous generation are the spontaneously-generated (sammūrcchina). The conduct-deluding karmas have two subdivisions – passions (kaÈāya) and quasi- assions (nokaÈāya). Owing to the rise of the quasi-passion (nokaÈāya) called the neuter sex sign – napuÉsakaveda, and of the inauspicious (aśubha) name-karma (nāmakarma), these – the nārakī and the sammūrcchina – are born as neither men nor women, but as neuter-sex (napuÉsaka). As a rule, the infernal beings and the spontaneously generated beings are neutersex (napuÉsaka) only. These do not enjoy even the slightest pleasure which the men and women derive from sweet sound, smell, colour (form), taste and touch.<br /><br />If it is determined thus, it would imply that the mundane beings other than these are of the three sexes. Those who are not neuter-sex (napuÉsaka) are mentioned next. ",
