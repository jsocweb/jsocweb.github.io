                    The description of the nature (svarūpa) of a substance is nirdeśa.
                    Svāmitva is ownership or lordship. Sādhana is the cause of origin.
                    Adhikaraõa is substratum. Sthiti is duration of existence of the
                    substance. Vidhāna is division.
                    <br /><br />
                    What is right faith (samyagdarśana)? The expression that it is faith in
                    substances as these really are, is nirdeśa. Also, installation of right
                    faith by name, etc., is nirdeśa.
                    <br /><br />
                    Who is its possessor? Generally speaking, it is the soul. To
                    particularize, one or more of the three types of right faith
                    (samyagdarśana) – subsidential (aupaśamika), destructional
                    (kÈāyika) and destruction-cum-subsidential (kÈāyopaśamika) – may be
                    possessed by the infernal beings (nāraka), the humans (manuÈya), the
                    plants and animals (tiryańca) and the celestial beings (deva). Only the
                    potential (bhavya – capable of attaining liberation) souls can attain the three types of right faith (samyagdarśana); the non-potential
                    (abhavya – not capable of attaining liberation) souls do not possess
                    any. The details can be read from ‘Sarvārthasiddhi’, p. 16-18.
                    <br /><br />
                    The cause of origin – sādhana – is of two kinds, internal and external.
                    The subsidence, destruction, or destruction-cum-subsidence of faithdeluding
                    (darśanamohanīya) karmas is the internal cause. In the first
                    three infernal regions, right faith arises in some by recollection of past
                    lives – jātismaraõa, in others by listening to the Scripture –
                    dharmaśravaõa, and in yet others by endurance of pain. From the
                    fourth up to the seventh, recollection of past lives and endurance of
                    pain promote right faith. In case of animals, right faith arises in some
                    by recollection of past lives, in some others by listening to the
                    Scripture and in yet others by witnessing the idols of Lord Jina. In
                    human beings also the same causes operate. In case of the celestial
                    beings, right faith is promoted in some by the recollection of past lives,
                    in some others by listening to the Scripture, in some others by
                    witnessing the glory of Lord Jina and in yet others by the sight of the
                    splendour and miraculous powers of other celestial beings. This
                    applies to celestial beings below the Ānata kalpa. In case of the deva of
                    Ānata, Prāõata, Āraõa and Acyuta kalpa only three causes, excluding
                    the sight of magnificence of other celestial beings, operate. The deva of
                    navagraiveyaka attain right faith by recollection of past lives or by
                    listening to discourses on religion. The question of origin does not
                    arise in case of higher celestial beings – those in anudiśa and anuttara
                    vimāna – for they are born with right faith.
                    <br /><br />
                    The substratum (adhikaraõa) is of two kinds, internal and external.
                    The soul which is the possessor of right faith is itself the internal
                    substratum of right faith. The external substratum is the mobilechannel
                    of the universe – trasanāçī. How extensive is it? It is one rajju
                    in diameter and fourteen rajju in length.
                    <br /><br />
                    As regard duration (sthiti), the minimum and maximum duration of
                    subsidential right faith is within one muhūrta (48 minutes). In case of
                    mundane living beings, the minimum duration of right faith resulting
                    from destruction is within one muhūrta and the maximum is thirty-three sāgaropama and two pūrvakoÇi less eight years and one
                    antarmuhūrta. In case of the emancipated, it has a beginning but no
                    end. The minimum duration of right faith arising from destructioncum-
                    subsidence is within one muhūrta, and the maximum is sixty-six
                    sāgaropama.
                    <br /><br />
                    As regard division (vidhāna), in general, right faith is one. From the
                    point of view of its origin, it is of two kinds, namely, by own-nature
                    (nisargaja) and by acquisition of knowledge (adhigamaja). It is of
                    three kinds from the point of view of its divisions into subsidential,
                    destructional and destruction-cum-subsidential. From the point of
                    view of verbal nomenclature, it is of numerous kinds. It is of
                    innumerable kinds on the basis of the believers. It is of infinite kinds
                    on the basis of objects which have to be believed in.
                    <br /><br />
                    These – description (nirdeśa) etc. – are to be similarly understood in
                    case of knowledge and conduct, and substances like the soul and the
                    non-soul, as per the Scripture.
                    <br /><br />
                    Are there further means of ascertaining the nature of right faith, the
                    soul and the rest? Yes, there are.
