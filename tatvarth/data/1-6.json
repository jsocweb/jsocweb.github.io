  "explanation": "The true nature of substances (soul, etc.) described in detail through the rule of installation (nāma), etc., can be ascertained through pramāõa and multitude of naya. The characteristics and divisions of pramāõa and naya are described now. Pramāõa is of two kinds, namely, for oneself (svārtha) and for others (parātha). All forms of knowledge, except scriptural knowledge, constitute pramāõa for oneself. But scriptural knowledge is of both kinds – for oneself and for others. Valid knowledge or knowledge itself constitutes pramāõa for oneself and knowledge in form of words constitutes pramāõa for others. The naya(s) are divisions of pramāõa. <br /><br /> It is contended that naya should be mentioned first as it consists of fewer letters than pramāõa. It is not a fault. Pramāõa is mentioned first as it is of superior excellence. As a rule, excellence is invincibility. How is pramāõa of superior excellence? As pramāõa is responsible for the origin of naya, it is of superior excellence. It has been said in the Scripture that after knowing the substance with the help of pramāõa, ascertaining its one particular state or mode is naya. Secondly, the scope of pramāõa comprises all attributes of the substance. It has been said in the Scripture that pramāõa is sakalādeśa – comprehensive and absolute, and naya is vikalādeśa – partial and relative. For this reason, too, pramāõa is of superior excellence. <br /><br /> Naya is of two kinds, dravyārthika naya and paryāyārthika naya. Paryāyārthika naya is concerned with bhāva nikÈepa – the present mode (paryāya) or actual state (bhāva) of the substance. Since bhāva nikÈepa refers to the mode (paryāya) of the substance, it is specific and falls under paryāyārthika naya. Dravyārthika naya is concerned with the other three nikÈepa – nāma, sthāpanā, and dravya – which are general in nature. Dravyārthika naya refers to the general attributes of the substance, and paryāyārthika naya to the constantly changing states or modes (paryāya) of the substance. That which has the substance as its object is the standpoint of substance – dravyārthika naya. That which has the mode (paryāya) as its object is the standpoint of modes – paryāyārthika naya. Both the substance and the modes are ascertained by pramāõa (comprehensive knowledge). <br /><br /> One method of understanding the nature of the soul, etc., by pramāõa and naya has been explained. Another method of ascertaining the soul, etc., is mentioned next.",
