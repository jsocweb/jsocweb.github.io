  "sutra": "सर्वस्य॥४२॥<br />Sarvasya ॥42॥",
  "audiosrc": "2-42.mp3",
  "arth": "ये (तैजस और कार्मण शरीर) [ सर्वस्य ] सब संसारी जीवों के होते हैं ।",
  "meaning": "These (two) are associated with all transmigratory souls.",
  "vyakhya": "ये दोनों शरीर सभी संसारी जीवों के होते हैं।",
  "explanation": "The word ‘sarva’ does not exclude anyone. These two types of bodies are possessed by all transmigratory souls.<br /><br />In general, this would lead to the interpretation that all the bodies are simultaneously associated with the mundane soul. To preclude such a view it is described how many bodies can exist with the soul, simultaneously. ",
