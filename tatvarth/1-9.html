                Knowledge is of five kinds – sensory-knowledge – matijñāna, scriptural-knowledge – śrutajñāna, clairvoyance – avadhijñāna, telepathy<sup>1</sup> – manaÍparyayajñāna,
                and omniscience – kevalajñāna.
            </div>
            1 – The word ‘telepathy’ is rather inadequate to convey the true import of the
            phrase ‘manaÍparyayajñāna’. Still, it has been used most reluctantly as there
            is no equivalent word in the English language that can represent the
            extraordinary power and scope of manaÍparyayajñāna.

                    The term ‘knowledge’ is to be taken with each kind mentioned in the
                    sūtra – sensory knowledge, scriptural knowledge, clairvoyant
                    knowledge, telepathic knowledge and perfect knowledge
                    (omniscience). That which reflects on the objects-of-knowledge
                    through the senses and the mind, or that through which the objects-ofknowledge
                    are reflected upon, or just reflection, is sensory knowledge.
                    Owing to the destruction-cum-subsidence (kÈayopaśama) of karmas
                    which obscure scriptural-knowledge, that, which hears, or through
                    which the ascertained objects are heard, or just hearing, is scriptural
                    knowledge. These two are mentioned side by side, as these are
                    governed by the relation of cause-and-effect. This is mentioned later,
                    ‘Scriptural knowledge is preceded by sensory knowledge’ (sūtra 1-20).
                    The next kind of knowledge is called clairvoyance (avadhi) as it
                    ascertains matter in downward range or knows objects within limits.
                    Ascertaining the objects located in another’s mind (mana) is telepathy
                    (manaÍparyaya). Now is telepathy not sensory knowledge? No. Mind
                    (mana) is merely relative; mind (mana) is merely spoken of with
                    reference to one’s own and another’s mind. Telepathy (manaÍparyaya)
                    works on the strength of destruction-cum-subsidence
                    (kÈayopaśama) alone of karmas of that kind. For instance we say,
                    “Look at the moon in the sky”. Here the sky is intended merely as the
                    background. That for the sake of which the seekers pursue the path of
                    external and internal austerities (tapa) is pure and perfect knowledge
                    (kevalajñāna). It also means ‘without the help of anything else’.
                    Perfect knowledge (kevalajñāna) is mentioned last as it is attained at
                    the end. Telepathy (manaÍparyayajñāna) is mentioned close to it because of its proximity. How is there proximity? Self-restraint
                    (saÉyama) is the basis of both. Clairvoyance (avadhijñāna) is far-off
                    from telepathy (manaÍparyayajñāna) hence it has been mentioned
                    before telepathy. Indirect (parokÈa) knowledge is mentioned before
                    direct (pratyakÈa) knowledge as it is easily intelligible. Almost all
                    beings are familiar with and experience sensory-knowledge
                    (matijñāna) and scriptural-knowledge (śrutajñāna), hence these are
                    easily intelligible. Thus, these are the five kinds of knowledge.
                    Their subdivisions are mentioned later.
                    <br /><br />
                    It has been said that knowledge (jñāna) is attained by means of
                    pramāõa and naya. Some consider pramāõa to be the knowledge,
                    some others consider pramāõa to be the connection, and yet others
                    consider pramāõa to be the senses. The next sūtra declares that only
                    the five kinds of knowledge mentioned in the sūtra are pramāõa.
